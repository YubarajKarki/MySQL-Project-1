# Employee Layoffs Data Analysis (2020-2023) üìä

## Project Overview  
Welcome to my first real-world SQL project! üöÄ As a data enthusiast, I aimed to uncover key insights into employee layoffs data from 2020 to 2023 using MySQL. This project involves cleaning and analyzing data to reveal trends across industries, countries, and time periods.

## Project Structure  
The project is divided into two main phases:

### I. Data Cleaning üßπ  
- **Removing Duplicates**: Ensured data integrity by eliminating duplicate records.  
- **Standardizing Formats**: Applied consistent formats for dates, roles, and company names.  
- **Handling Missing Values**: Filled in blanks or removed rows where necessary using `COALESCE()` and `ISNULL()`.  
- **Trimming Unnecessary Columns/Rows**: Focused the dataset by removing redundant information.  

### II. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) üîç  
- Analyzed key metrics, including the sum of layoffs by year, country, industry, company, and date.  
- Uncovered trends and patterns to offer actionable insights.  

## Challenges Faced üöß  
1. **Large Datasets**: Required efficient querying techniques for smooth processing.  
2. **Balancing Accuracy and Performance**: Managed complex joins and subqueries for precise, high-performance queries.  

## Key Techniques and SQL Skills üí°  
- **Data Manipulation**: Used `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `DELETE`, and `UPDATE` for data processing.  
- **Missing Value Handling**: Leveraged `COALESCE()` and `ISNULL()` for filling gaps.  
- **Duplicates Removal**: Utilized `DISTINCT` and `ROW_NUMBER()` to remove duplicate records.  
- **Data Standardization**: Used `LOWER()`, `UPPER()`, and `TRIM()` for consistent formatting.  
- **Outlier Detection**: Analyzed data distribution using `GROUP BY`.  
- **Data Type Conversion**: Ensured correct data types with `CAST()` and `CONVERT()`.  
- **Window Functions**: Applied ranking and running totals for deeper insights.  
- **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**: Made complex queries more readable and manageable.  
- **Mastering JOINs**: Combined multiple tables for a comprehensive analysis.  

## Acknowledgments üôè  
A huge thanks to [Alex Freberg](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alex-freberg/) for his data analytics course and bootcamp videos. Your clear explanations and comprehensive resources helped me take my skills to the next level!

## Conclusion  
This project has been an invaluable learning experience, showing how SQL can transform raw data into meaningful insights. I'm excited to continue my journey in data analytics!
